# Rieth Research

**Central Bank Communication Analytics & Financial NLP Research**

Rieth Research specializes in natural language processing of central bank communications and monetary policy analysis. We develop domain-specific AI models and datasets to advance understanding of financial text patterns and policy communication strategies.

## Research Focus

- **Central Bank Communication Analysis**: NLP techniques for analyzing statements from RBNZ, Federal Reserve, and other central banks
- **Monetary Policy Stance Detection**: Automated classification of hawkish/dovish/neutral policy language
- **Financial Domain NLP**: Custom tokenizers and models optimized for financial and economic text
- **Time-Series Text Analytics**: Tracking communication patterns and language evolution over time

## Available Models

### Classification Models
- **Central Bank Classifier**: Identifies which central bank issued a communication
- **Policy Stance Analyzer**: Detects the monetary policy orientation (hawkish/dovish/neutral)
- **Communication Type Classifier**: Distinguishes between statements, implementation notes, and other documents

### Analysis Tools
- **Financial Domain Tokenizer**: Custom tokenizer trained on central bank communications
- **Temporal Analysis Pipeline**: Tracks language changes across time periods
- **Policy Language Extractor**: Identifies key monetary policy terms and phrases

## Datasets

### Central Bank Communications
- **RBNZ OCR Statements**: Official Cash Rate decisions (2006-2012)
- **Federal Reserve FOMC**: Statements and implementation notes (2012-2017)
- **Annotated Policy Data**: Labeled datasets for training and evaluation

## Methodology

Our approach combines:
- Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned on financial text
- Domain-specific preprocessing for OCR-corrected documents
- Time-series analysis for tracking communication evolution
- Rigorous evaluation with financial domain-specific metrics

## Mission

"Democratizing access to advanced NLP tools for financial research through open-source models and datasets."
